## Project Proposal 1:
--------------------------------
### Smart Blinds - Home Automation Project.
Abstract: It is solving the problem of extra energy and at the same time giving more convenience to user. Rather than having unnecessary light from a light source, the automated light sensing smart blinds can sense the amount of light outside the window and in the room, and then adjust whether to turn open/off the blinds to save energy by utilizing the available outdoor light. This way, the light source will not be running at maximum power output while there is excess light coming through the window. The project aims to design and construct the light sensing blinds. Also on the top of this user will have an option to switch open/off blinds using an app and through voice recognition as well.

Technologies Used: Arduino Uno, Light Sensor, Client/Interface module, Motor.


## Project Proposal 2:
--------------------------------
### Emergency Healthcare Watch for seniors.

Scenario: With this watch, elderly, or people with disabilities, can trigger an emergency alarm. The emergency update send an email and text with location of person and pre recorded message to pre-defined contacts. Also it'll have pulse detection, which can detect pulse and accordingly send the updates as well.  
Also the watch can receive messages/instructions regarding special medications to be given to the people.


## Project Proposal 3:
--------------------------------
### Smart Home Ambience System.
Scenario: With this system enabled, when user enters the home or any area fitted with thim system, then system based on user activity and mood, will automatically set music, lights and temperature. 
And more on this this model will also learn as the user ineract with this system and improve the predictions.
