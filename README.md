## Project Proposal 1:
--------------------------------
### Smart Blinds - Home Automation Project. - APPROVED
Abstract: It is solving the problem of extra energy and at the same time giving more convenience to user. Rather than having unnecessary light from a light source, the automated light sensing smart blinds can sense the amount of light outside the window and in the room, and then adjust whether to turn open/off the blinds to save energy by utilizing the available outdoor light. This way, the light source will not be running at maximum power output while there is excess light coming through the window. The project aims to design and construct the light sensing blinds. Also on the top of this user will have an option to switch open/off blinds using an app and through voice recognition as well.

Technologies Used: Arduino Uno, Light Sensor, Client/Interface module, Motor.
